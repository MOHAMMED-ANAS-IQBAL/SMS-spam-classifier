# **SMS Spam Classifier** 📩🔍  
A machine learning-based web application built with **Streamlit** that classifies SMS messages as **Spam or Not Spam** using **Ensemble Learning**. The model leverages multiple algorithms for improved accuracy and robustness.

## **Features**  
✅ Preprocesses text using **tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming**  
✅ Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**  
✅ Utilizes **Ensemble Learning** for better classification performance  
✅ Interactive **Streamlit UI** for easy message classification  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Streamlit** 🎨  
- **NLTK** (for text preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML model & ensemble learning)  
- **Pickle** (for saving and loading the model & vectorizer)
